ResellAI – iOS Reselling Tracker

ResellAI is a personal iOS app prototype built with SwiftUI that helps resellers track purchases, sales, receipts, and profitability. It combines Core Data persistence, dashboards, machine learning (OCR), barcode scanning, and Firebase authentication into one seamless experience.

Features
	•	Core Data persistence
  •	Store products, purchase details, sales history, and receipts locally.
	•	Interactive dashboards (Swift Charts)
	•	Monthly profit/loss bars
	•	Sales vs. spend line charts
	•	Top profit items leaderboard
	•	Vision OCR Integration
	•	Automatically extract brand, category, and price from uploaded receipts.
	•	Barcode scanning (AVFoundation)
	•	Scan product barcodes and auto-fill product codes.
	•	CSV Export & ShareSheet
	•	Export all item data for analysis in Excel/Google Sheets.
	•	Firebase Authentication
	•	Email/password login flow
	•	Secure user sessions
	•	Receipts & Media Handling
	•	Attach photos of purchase/sale receipts
	•	Store safely in Core Data

Tech Stack
	•	Language & Frameworks: Swift, SwiftUI
	•	Data: Core Data (with migrations)
	•	Charts & Visualisation: Swift Charts
	•	Machine Learning: Vision OCR (receipt scanning)
	•	Camera/Scanning: AVFoundation (barcodes)
	•	Authentication: Firebase Auth
	•	Export: CSV generation + ShareSheet
	•	Version Control: Git + GitHub

Learning Outcomes

Building ResellAI gave me hands-on experience with:
	•	Managing Core Data migrations and debugging schema validation issues
	•	Working with iOS system frameworks like Vision and AVFoundation
	•	Designing data-driven dashboards with Swift Charts
	•	Implementing authentication flows with Firebase
	•	Exporting and sharing structured data in CSV format
	•	Handling real-world version control issues with Git

Project Status

This is a prototype project built for portfolio and learning purposes.
Not distributed on the App Store (runs locally via Xcode).

Future Improvements
	•	CloudKit/iCloud sync
	•	Public product lookup from barcodes
	•	Multi-user collaboration
	•	Improved OCR models for receipt parsing
